The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a web-based application developed to manage the day-to-day
operations of a hospital in a digital and efficient manner. The system automates core hospital activities such
as patient registration, doctor management, appointment booking, medical history tracking, and diagnosis
handling. This project was developed as part of a DBMS / Web Application academic project to demonstrate
the practical use of databases integrated with a web framework.
